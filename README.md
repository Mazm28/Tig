# Tig - A Simple Version Control System

**Tig** is a lightweight version control system (VCS) inspired by Git. It provides basic functionality for tracking changes in your files, committing them, branching, tagging, and more. Tig is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it a great tool for small projects or learning how version control systems work.

## Example Workflow

1. Initialize a repository:
   ```bash
   tig init
   ```

2. Add files to the staging area:
   ```bash
   tig add file1.txt file2.txt
   ```

3. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   tig commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   tig branch feature-branch
   ```

5. Switch to the new branch:
   ```bash
   tig checkout feature-branch
   ```

6. Make changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   tig add file3.txt
   tig commit -m "Added file3.txt"
   ```

7. View the commit history:
   ```bash
   tig log
   ```

8. Create a tag:
   ```bash
